                    "Let food be the medicine and not medicine be the food" is Dr Anjanaâ€™s guiding principle for weight loss program.</p>
                <p>

                    According to Ayurveda different constitutions/ prakritis (vata / pitta/ kapha ) respond differently to different foods. Also as per blood group theory by Dr D Adamo different blood groups respond differently to each food group.
                    Our weight loss program is designed based on Ayurvedic constitution and blood type in conjunction with lifestyle changes.  Broadly we classify each individual on the basis of his /her constitution (vata,pitta, kapha ) and blood group(A, B,AB & O) . However each person has unique body composition and responds differently to each food group. During initial period of diet program we study the response of our Constitution and Blood type diet plan on each individual and then design the individual diet plan.
</p><p>
                    What you eat matters more than how much you eat. Weight loss by starving is not healthy way and can also lead to deficiency of important nutrients. We focus more on having right type of food than quantity of the food. As per the international standards losing 3-4kg per month is safe and healthy.
<p>
                    Rate of weightloss varies from individual to individual and depend upon Factors like Gender, Age, Metabolic Rate etc</p>
